## üöÄ **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**:
- **React** - A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** - A superset of JavaScript that adds static types for better development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for fast UI development with a custom design.
- **React Query** - A library for fetching, caching, and syncing server data in React applications. It helps manage asynchronous server-state and makes data fetching and synchronization smoother and more efficient.
  
### **Backend**:
- **Express** - A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Node.js** - A JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable backend services.
- **MongoDB** - A NoSQL database used for storing user data and resume templates.

## üí° **How It Works**

### **Frontend:**
1. **User Input**: The frontend provides forms for users to input their personal information, work experience, education, and skills.
2. **Real-time Preview**: As users fill out their details, they can see a live preview of their resume on the same page.
3. **React Query for Data Fetching**: React Query is used to fetch resume templates and user data from the backend, ensuring the UI is synchronized with the server.
4. **PDF Export**: When the resume is ready, users can download their resume as a PDF.

### **Backend:**
1. **API Endpoints**: The backend provides APIs to save user data, fetch resume templates, and generate PDF files.
2. **MongoDB**: Data such as user information, saved resumes, and templates are stored in MongoDB.
3. **Express Server**: Handles all HTTP requests, provides endpoints, and serves the frontend application.
